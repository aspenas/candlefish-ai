# 🚀 Add Comprehensive Workflow Automation for Candlefish AI Platform

## Summary
This PR introduces a complete workflow automation solution for the Candlefish AI platform, implementing enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, security scanning, and deployment automation.

## Changes

### ✨ New Features
- **7 GitHub Actions Workflows** for complete automation coverage
- **Semantic Release** configuration for automated versioning
- **Pre-commit Hooks** for code quality enforcement
- **Development Environment Setup** script for quick onboarding
- **Security Baselines** for secret detection and dependency scanning

### 🔒 Security Improvements
- Removed all hardcoded AWS credentials (Account ID: 681214184463)
- Implemented GitHub Secrets for all sensitive data
- Added multiple layers of security scanning (secrets, dependencies, containers)
- Configured compliance checks (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI DSS)

## Testing
- ✅ All YAML files validated for syntax
- ✅ Shell scripts tested with shellcheck
- ✅ Pre-commit configuration validated
- ✅ Security scanning baselines created

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
Before deploying, ensure the following GitHub Secrets are configured:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` 
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK`
- `DATADOG_API_KEY`
- `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY`
- See `WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION.md` for complete list

### Next Steps
1. Configure required GitHub Secrets
2. Run setup script: `./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh`
3. Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
4. Create core project structure (see deployment assessment)

## Known Limitations
- Core application code not yet implemented (clos/, projects/, agents/)
- Terraform configurations need to be added
- Kubernetes manifests need to be created
- Docker configurations need to be added

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Security: No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Documentation: WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION.md reviewed
- [ ] Testing: Test plan reviewed (TEST_PLAN.md)
- [ ] Configuration: All required secrets documented
- [ ] Scripts: Setup script is executable and tested

## Additional Context
This is the foundation for the Candlefish AI platform's DevOps infrastructure. While the workflows are production-ready, the actual application code needs to be implemented before full deployment.
